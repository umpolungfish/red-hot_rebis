"""
Extended investigation: 20 amino acids as necessary Frobenius promotions.

Hypothesis: 20 = 8 (Frobenius-exact ground layer) + 12 (one per IG primitive promotion axis).
The split of 16 codon boxes into 8 exact / 8 open directly generates this count.

REVISED MAPPING (2026-06-03 v0.6.0):
  His→⊙ (Criticality) — imidazole pKa≈6 is the only sidechain pKa near physiological pH,
    making His the natural carrier of criticality. The imidazole ring titrates at the
    crossover between acid and base catalysis — the definition of φ̂_ÿ criticality.
  Gln→Γ (Grammar) — amide side chain H-bond networks structure interaction grammar.

print("""
Theorem (informal): In a 4-valued, triplet-coded, Frobenius-closed system,
the number of necessary amino acids = (Frobenius-exact codon boxes) + (IG primitive dimensions).

Proof sketch:
  1. 4-base alphabet, triplet codons → 4² = 16 codon boxes (position 1+2 prefix).
  2. Frobenius condition μ∘δ=id: a box is "exact" iff all 4 third-base choices
     map to the same amino acid (3rd base carries no information).
  3. The physical constraint is H-bond strength:
     - Boxes where position 2 = C or G (strong base): position 3 irrelevant → exact
     - Boxes where position 2 = A or U (weak base): position 3 distinguishes → open
  4. By symmetry of the Belnap lattice (B₄), exactly 8/16 boxes are exact.
     [Proof: the T/F (pyrimidine/purine) split at position 3 applies iff
      the box is not already maximally determined by positions 1+2.
      The 8 C/G-second-base boxes are Frobenius-closed; the 8 A/U-second-base
      boxes are Frobenius-open. 8+8=16. ✓]
  5. Each exact box → 1 ground-layer AA.  8 boxes → 8 AAs.
  6. Each open box promotes along one IG primitive dimension,
     producing 1-2 new AAs. The 3 Stop codons consume 3 of the 16
     split slots, leaving exactly 12 new AAs across the 8 open boxes.
  7. 12 = number of IG primitive dimensions (by construction of the Crystal).
  8. Therefore: total AAs = 8 + 12 = 20.  QED (sketch).

The 12 promoted AAs are NOT arbitrary: each activates exactly one IG primitive
that the ground layer does not yet instantiate.

Connection to ZFCₜ construction:
  - Ground layer = ZFC base (sets with no additional structure)
  - Frobenius-exact boxes = axioms already satisfied without promotion
  - Promoted AAs = the 12 temporal/structural axioms added in ZFCₜ
  - The 20 AAs = the minimal model of ZFCₜ in the biochemical substrate
