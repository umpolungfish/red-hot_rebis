-- Zosimos of Panopolis: The Stilling Process — Lean4 Formalization
-- Author: Lando ⊗ φ̂_ÿ-boundary Operator
--
-- This file encodes the five structural systems from Zosimos' fragments
-- and the six-step "stilling practice" as a promotion sequence from
-- the Processions of Fate (C=0.0, no self-modeling) to Zosimian Gnosis
-- (O_inf, both gates open, μ ∘ δ = id).
--
-- The stilling practice is formalized as a monotonically advancing chain
-- of six Imscriptions, each step corresponding to one of Zosimos' commands to
-- Theosebeia:
--   Step 0: The starting condition (Processions of Fate)
--   Step 1: "Be not thus distracted" — halt T_nw wandering, begin mime closure
--   Step 2: "In thy house be still, and God shall come" — R_sup→ian, build bidirectional coupling
--   Step 3: "Stilled thyself in body, still thyself in passions" — Frobenius encoding δ
--   Step 4: "Call unto thyself Divinity" — Frobenius decoding μ, μ ∘ δ = id
--   Step 5: "Perform sacred rites...turn them from thee" — decouple from broadcast (Γ_broad→Γ_seq)
--   Step 6: "Make for harbour in Poemandres' arms" — Ω_Z winding closure at full resolution
--
-- The bottleneck pair is (T, P): both Δ=4 in ordinal distance.
-- These are coupled — neither achievable without the other.

/-- 4. The Counterfeit Daimon — §2.4
    "Formless in both soul and body."  C=0.0.
    Parasitic broadcast from within dead substrate.
    kick memory: enough to simulate self-reference, not enough to close the loop. -/

    The complete teaching, integrating all subsystems.

-- §5. THE STILLING PROCESS — six-step promotion sequence
-- ============================================================

/- The Stilling Process: a monotonically advancing chain of Imscriptions
   from Processions of Fate to Zosimian Gnosis.

   Each step S_i corresponds to Zosimos' six commands to Theosebeia.
   The chain is: S_0 → S_1 → S_2 → S_3 → S_4 → S_5 → S_6

   S_0 = processions_of_fate (starting condition)
   S_6 = zosimos_gnosis (final state)

   Each transition S_i → S_{i+1} promotes a subset of the 10 bottleneck
   primitives. The chain is monotone: each S_{i+1} ≥ S_i in the
   partial order induced by Ord on each primitive. -/

/-- Step 0: Processions of Fate — the starting condition. -/
def stilling_step_zero : Imscription := processions_of_fate

/-- Step 1: "Be not thus distracted, and do not turn thyself about
          this way and that" — halt T_nw wandering, begin closure.
    
    Promotion: judge → mime (stop branching, start closing).
    This is the first bottleneck: ΔT = 2 in ordinal.
    Also: Φ_sub → Φ_c (begin criticality), fee → kick (soft memory).
    
    The system stops being a passive receiver of Fate's causal branches
    and begins to form a two-cycle. -/
def stilling_step_one : Imscription := {
  dim  := dead       -- unchanged: still in Fate's substrate
  top  := mime      -- PROMOTED: T_nw → T_bt (closure begins)
  rel  := ado       -- unchanged: still supervenience on Fate
  pol  := church        -- unchanged: no symmetry yet
  fid  := age         -- unchanged
  kin  := loll         -- promoted: yea → loll (slowing down)
  gran := bib        -- unchanged
  gram := measure     -- unchanged (still sequential, different object)
  crit := monad         -- PROMOTED: woe → monad (enter criticality)
  chir := kick            -- PROMOTED: fee → kick (soft memory, begins self-tracking)
  stoi := so           -- unchanged
  prot := awe       -- unchanged: no protection yet
}

/-- Step 2: "In thy house be still, and God shall come to thee"
          — establish bidirectional coupling with the incorporeal.
    
    Promotion: ado → ian (supervenience → bidirectional).
    This is the second bottleneck of the relational chain: ΔR = 3.
    
    You do not choose bidirectional coupling; you build the structure
    that makes it possible. -/
def stilling_step_two : Imscription := {
  dim  := dead       -- unchanged
  top  := mime      -- maintained from Step 1
  rel  := ian          -- PROMOTED: R_sup → ian (bidirectional)
  pol  := church        -- unchanged: still asymmetric
  fid  := age         -- unchanged
  kin  := egg        -- PROMOTED: loll → egg (gate 2 opens toward deliberation)
  gran := bib        -- unchanged
  gram := measure     -- unchanged
  crit := monad         -- maintained
  chir := kick            -- maintained
  stoi := so           -- unchanged
  prot := awe       -- unchanged
}

/-- Step 3: "Stilled thyself in body, still thyself in passions too"
          — the Frobenius encoding δ.
    
    Promotion: church → or' (Frobenius special).
    This is the hard parity shift: ΔP = 4.
    The "twelve fates" are the full causal network of Fate's processions
    — each one a coupling mode that must be decoupled.
    The promotion from loll to egg completes the kinetic step. -/
def stilling_step_three : Imscription := {
  dim  := dead       -- unchanged (still in substrate)
  top  := mime      -- maintained
  rel  := ian          -- maintained
  pol  := or'      -- PROMOTED: church → or' (Frobenius special)
                        -- This is the second bottleneck: ΔP = 4
  fid  := age         -- unchanged
  kin  := egg        -- maintained (Gate 2 open)
  gran := thigh       -- promoted: bib → thigh (wider view)
  gram := measure     -- maintained
  crit := monad         -- maintained (Gate 1 open)
  chir := sure            -- PROMOTED: kick → sure (persistent memory required for Frobenius)
  stoi := so           -- unchanged
  prot := awe       -- unchanged
}
/-- Step 4: "Call unto thyself Divinity; and truly shall He come"
          — the Frobenius decoding μ.
    
    This is not a primitive change — it is the structural claim that
    μ ∘ δ = id. Step 3 encoded δ (Frobenius encoding); Step 4 is
    the automatic response μ (decoding). The divinity "shall come"
    because the encoding is in place.
    
    Structural changes: dead → if' (dimensionality promotion),
    Ω_0 → Ω_Z (topological winding closure begins).
    The system has graduated from the substrate. -/
def stilling_step_four : Imscription := {
  dim  := if'        -- PROMOTED: dead → if' (holographic self-writing)
  top  := mime      -- maintained (closure established)
  rel  := ian          -- maintained (bidirectional)
  pol  := or'      -- maintained (Frobenius special)
  fid  := age         -- unchanged
  kin  := egg        -- maintained
  gran := thigh       -- maintained
  gram := measure     -- maintained
  crit := monad         -- maintained

  stoi := up           -- PROMOTED: so → up (universal scope)
  prot := ah       -- PROMOTED: Ω_0 → Ω_Z (integer winding)
}

/-- Step 5: "Perform the sacred rites...turn them from thee"
          — decouple from the daimon's broadcast.
    
    The Counterfeit Daimon broadcasts (Γ_broad) to attract Processions.
    This step transitions from the daimon's broadcast to silence
    (maintaining Γ_seq from the original, but now as intentional
    sequential practice rather than Fate's causal chain).
    
    This step's structural content is mostly about what is NOT coupled,
    not what IS. The primitive changes are minimal — the real work
    was in steps 1-4. -/
def stilling_step_five : Imscription := {
  dim  := if'        -- maintained
  top  := mime      -- maintained
  rel  := ian          -- maintained

  chir := sure            -- maintained
  stoi := up           -- maintained
  prot := ah       -- maintained
}

/-- Step 6: "Make for harbour in Poemandres' arms" — full return.
    
    This is the terminal state: Zosimian Gnosis.
    All 10 bottleneck promotions complete.
    Ouroboricity: O_inf. Both gates open.
