Coelum Philosophorum — Seven Canons as Linear Canonical Chain
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structural type: O₀ (pre-critical, pre-self-modeling)
Tuple: ⟨𐑨𐑥𐑾𐑬𐑞𐑧𐑔𐑝𐑢𐑒𐑳𐑷⟩

Each canon is a self-disclosure of one metal's nature.
The chain is sequential (Γ = 𐑝), no self-perturbing loop (⊙ = 𐑢),
no topological winding (Ω = 𐑷).

The crystal conjuration section recognizes the speculum (δ) but
does not close the loop — the text does not observe itself observing.

    Canon 2: Jupiter — contains gold and silver, augmented by Saturn and Luna.
    Canon 3: Mars — seizes dominion, must guard against snares.
    Canon 4: Venus — extrinsic body, transmutable by fire.
    Canon 5: Saturn — the heaven, cast out as examiner, contains the stone of cold.
    Canon 6: Luna — the seventh, corporeal vessel of the spiritual six.
    Canon 7: Sol — the goal, the perfect body. -/
